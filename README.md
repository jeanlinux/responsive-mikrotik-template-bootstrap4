Just plug and play on your MikroTik router.

## Installation

- Open winbox and login to your MikroTik router
- Open the filesystem and upload this theme
- Check your hotspot page

## Local development

To get started working on this project in a local dev environment, follow the below instructions.

Make sure you have the `Live Sass Compiler extension` installed by Glenn Marks to compile your scss to scss. Download it from your IDE.

installed the `Live Server` extension by Ritwick Dey to run a local dev server. it works just like nodemon.

after having the above mentioned extensions installed, you should configure a savePath to compile all the scss files into css.

**NOTE**: This project uses `scss`. Writing your CSS styles directly in the CSS directory is not advisable, as they will be replaced when `scss` is compiled.

## Configuring a savePath or dir

1. Go to settings or press `ctrl + ,` on Mac `Command + ,`
2. Search for `Live Sass Compiler`. Make sure you have it installed
3. under `Live Sass Compile â€º Settings: Autoprefix` click on the `Edit in settings.json`
4. In the settings.json file find:

```json

"liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
  {
   "extensionName": ".css",
   "savePath": "/assets/css",
   "savePathReplacementPairs": null
  }
 ],

```

and change the `savePath` to **/assets/css**

**NOTE**: It is preferred to use `/assets/css` specifically for this project. Setting a new savePath will create a duplicate compilation dir.

## Compiling the SCSS files to CSS

- Find the watch sass button at the bottom of the terminal bar and click on it to compile your scss files.

If you cant find watch sass, open your command palette by pressing `ctrl + P` on Mac `Command + P`. and then type `> watch sass`.

Make sure you have the compilation directory specified to this projects required dir or a new location will be used for the compilation of the css files. [How to configure the savePath](#configuring-a-savepath-or-dir)

If in your console, the output is `watching` then it means everything is working fine.

## Running the local dev server

- Find the Go live button at the bottom of the terminal and click on it to run the dev server. Make sure you have `Live Server` extension by Ritwick Dey installed.

If you cant find Go Live at the bottom of the terminal open your command palette by pressing `ctrl + P` on Mac `Command + P`. and then type `> live sass`.

## An overview of how the scss folder is structure

The **theme.scss** imports all of the scss files in the \_partials and \_pages directory and compiles them into the css directory.

inside the **\_pages** directory, each file includes styles for a page. e.g the **\_dashboard.scss** includes the styles for the **dashboard page**. Noticed there is an `_index.scss` file in the root. The **index.scss** `@forwards` all the files in a directory and includes them in the `theme.scss` file so that it compiles them.

## Creating a new stylesheet for a page

To create a new stylesheet for a page, get into the scss directory and inside `_pages` create your file. **e.g demo.scss**

after creating a stylesheet, open the `_index.scss` file located at the root of that directory and `@forward "./demo";`. ignore the extension.

**NB**: Do the above for every stylesheet you add.
